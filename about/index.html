            <p>Welcome to my website, a love letter to simpler times.</p>
            <p>The internet is pretty much dead. What do I mean by that? Well, according to some metrics, which are already outdated and conservative by their estimates, much of the content seen today on the internet is "AI" generated. There is very little human output, and every dumb little bot can now pass the Turing test easily. The web just doesn't feel like it used to, because it's infested with bots, ads, marketing and greed. I'm doing my best to bring back some of the magic into my corner of the internet. I'm one of those people who still hang out in IRC rooms, because it's an iconic staple of my beloved hacker culture...even though I technically wasn't around in the prime-time, I was still lucky enough to live through the end of the "golden era" of the digital wild west, before those damn fences were built...</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>I was inspired by one of nerdcore's finest, YTcracker the digital gangster himself. His site ytcracker.com is quite a beautiful and creative sight to behold. I list more sites that I came across in my "research" below, even though most of these sites use a ton of complicated javascript frameworks, which are not present in my project. I wanted to use only simple HTML and minimal JS, as it would be a fun challenge and a spiritual callback to websites of the past. The games used can be found in the project repository. </p>
